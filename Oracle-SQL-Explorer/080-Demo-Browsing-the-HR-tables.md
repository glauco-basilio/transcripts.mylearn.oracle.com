# Browsing the HR tables

This demo is about browsing the HR schema tables and looking at the data within it. So you'll note here this looks very similar to what we saw before in our diagram. We see Job History, Employees, Departments. Again, you'll see how they're related to each other.

Likewise, if we go to-- and I'm going to go back here to Data and click on Employees, Similar Information. Likewise for locations and so forth. All right, that was a nice quick demonstration here on looking at the HR schema. We didn't investigate all tables, but I think you get the gist of it.
