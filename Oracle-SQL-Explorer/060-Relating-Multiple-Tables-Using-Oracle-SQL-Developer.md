# Relating Multiple Tables Using Oracle SQL Developer

In this demo, we're going to demonstrate how to relate multiple tables using Oracle SQL Developer. In order to get started with this, we'll need to navigate over to our remote machine. And we'll do that. We are now on our remote machine.

I have SQL Developer already launched, so I'll simply step into it. You'll see that, again, by convention, I've got my connection already established there, so I'll simply begin to write my select statement. I'm going to select, and it's going to be employee ID. Let's do last name and let's do department name.

From employee. We're going to join departments Using department ID. And then we colon, and let's go ahead and fire that one off now. And you'll see our result.

Pointing out here, again, employee ID and last name come from the employee's table. We're relating them to departments table so we can get to department name. See our results down on the bottom. And that will conclude this demonstration of relating tables to each other.
